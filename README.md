# Magento Web Test Automation Project [In Progress]

This project is a web test automation framework for testing the [Magento](https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/)
e-commerce platform using Java, Selenium WebDriver, Cucumber, and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. It
incorporates TestNGâ€™s `DataProvider` for parameterized testing and is designed to enhance test coverage and identify
critical defects early by automating core user workflows.

## Project Overview

This project automates key workflows on a real-world e-commerce
website, [Magento](https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/), to ensure a seamless user experience. The automation
includes:

- **Login functionality**
- **Product search**
- **Adding products to the cart**
- **An E2E use case**

### Core Framework Features:

- **IntelliJ IDEA**: The development environment for building and maintaining the framework.
- **Maven**: For managing project dependencies and build automation.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: To interact with web elements and perform browser automation.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: To create a maintainable and reusable object-oriented framework.
- **TestNG DataProvider**: For parameterized, data-driven testing that allows testing multiple data sets.
- **Cucumber**: For Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and writing human-readable test cases.

### Framework Objective:

The goal is to create a robust test framework that increases test coverage and helps in early detection of critical
defects, providing a maintainable and scalable testing solution.
